# TF2 HUD
Hello! I'm BreadSandvich, and I'm making a custom TF2 HUD. It's certainly not the greatest thing ever, and will most likely never be finished, but it's slowly getting there. This HUD strongly emphasizes minimalism, and as such many elements that I deemed visual clutter and not absolutely necessary to general gameplay have been removed to create a cleaner, more simplistic interface. Feel free to download/test/edit as you wish. If you have any feedback, please feel free to contact me on Steam at /id/BreadSandvich.

Thanks!
