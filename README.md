# TF2 HUD
Yo! I'm Bread, and I'm making a custom TF2 HUD. In it's current state, it's nowhere near finished. However, I thought I'd upload the files to GitHub to give people an easy means of downloading it for playtesting purposes. If you'd like to test this Frankenstein-esque abomination of a HUD for me and add me on Steam at /id/BreadSandvich to give me feedback or recommendations, I'd really appreciate it!

Cheers,

Bread
