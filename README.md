# TF2 HUD
Yo! I'm Bread, and I made some progress on a custom TF2 HUD. I hoped that one day it would be finished. However, I've since lost all motivation for TF2 and HUD-making in general, so I will no longer be updating this. I figure I may as well leave the HUD files up here in case anyone wants a partially complete HUD. If you'd like to continue developing it for whatever reason, add me on Steam and let me know at /id/BreadSandvich. I'd like to see how it turns out!

Thanks,
Bread
